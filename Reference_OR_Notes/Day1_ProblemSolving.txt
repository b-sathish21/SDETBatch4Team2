Problem Solving Video - KT by Hema
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Did we understand the problem
	if yes 
	if no

2. test data
	[positive | Edge | Negative]

3. Do we have solution to the problem
	if yes
	if no
	- Create Trust
	- Interact with panel throughout the session
	- Multiple soution known?
	- Ask for Hints

4. Ask for the Hints
	if sol known OK
	else appologise and ask for another question

5. Alternate Solution
	-Brute sol

6. If more than one sol known then what we have to do
	- explain the solution to the panel and express the best solution at the end with justification

7. start with Psedocode
	- basic english [BDD - Beha Dr Dev]

8.later implement the code
	- documentary of the steps is imp

9. test with diff data

10.debug & Fix
---------------------------------------------------------------
Sug: Please have notepad & eclipse(or any other IDE) side by side. So we shall start writing the code in the notepad and verify the same in IDE.

Sample Problem Solving implementing the 10 steps - by Lokesh
---------------------------------------------------------------
"greatest num given" - Example Problem

1. "In the set of array provided please identify the greatest num and return the index of it" - Question got clarified/ reframed from the panel.
	- Need Array example from panel: [1, 5, 12, 6, 9] example provided from the panel.
	- constraints: shall we use any methods (sorting) [Panel rejects]

2. Test Data:
	[Positive | Edge | Negative]
	- sample Test data provided by panel, we have only positive.
	- Need not to raise comment for creating more sample test data from our end to have edge & negative.

3. Do I know how to solve the problem.
	- Brute force: 
	- Not showing the eagerness to the panel.
	- taking 15 sec and then saying will try to solve it.
	- Thinking of multiple ways to solve it.
	- If we are not able to think of an solution, asking for the hint from the panel.

4. Asking Hint:
	- Politely ask for the hint
